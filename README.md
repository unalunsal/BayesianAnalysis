# BayesianNeuralNetwork.py
This code calculates the out of sample prediction accuracy by using Bayesian Neural Network. 
Most of the examples on pymc3 documentation focus on the models for data with binary outcomes. 
With this code, I am predicting a dependent variable with multinomial output by using Bayesian Neural Network. 
Data that I am using is the Iris data set and its independent variable has 3 distinct values (0,1,2). 
If you want to expand this code for data with more than 3 outcomes then you will need to update the Y numpy nd array. 
Currently, Y has 3 binary columns since it has 3 distinct outcomes. I will automate this part in the future. 
Thanks.
